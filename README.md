Advent of Code in Golang, 2024

This is the closest I got to finishing Advent of Code, missing days 20,21,24,25.

My personal favorite was day 17, as it was a quine (self referential program).

My conclusion from attempting this year was that for me it is not worth doing all the problems in a year. Advent of code taught me something about my own habits on perfectionism and how they can get in my way -- going forward, I will

1) skip earlier problems, e.g. days 1-10 or so, since I don't get much out of
doing them.

2) Instead of aiming to do all the problems in december, I will look at the entire repertoire of existing advent of code problems as a set of hard problems that I can cherry pick and work on one at a time as a fun exercise at any time of the year. Like a sunday crossword. 

3) Use the easier problems whenever I'm learning a new programming language. I
think advent of code is fantastic for greasing the groove with a programming
language.
